#+Title: Projektkurs Volkswirtschaftslehre: let the computer do the calculations


* Description

Modern economics relies heavily on mathematical models. Solving these models by hand is usually burdensome and often outright infeasible. In these cases, computers can be used to analyse and solve economic models numerically. This project course gives an introduction to solving models numerically with the help of the computer. It is suitable for students with no (or little) prior knowledge of numerical analysis and/or programming.

The first part of the course gives an introduction to programming using the programming language "julia". The second part shows how to use julia to do numerical analysis (solving equations, maximizing functions, creating plots etc.). In the third part, students undertake a small project in which they use the skills acquired in the first two parts.

Students are asked to watch video tutorials (part 1) or "notebooks" (part 2) at home. In class questions on these are answered and students work on small exercises.

The skills acquired in this course will be particularly useful for writing term papers or a thesis but are also valued on the job market.

*Time and place:* Thursdays 10:00-11:30, SSC basement, seminar room S37 (102/U1/-1.314)

** Beyond this course
- [[https://julia.quantecon.org/intro.html][QuantEcon]] is a graduate course in quantitative economics using julia. The material is beyond the scope of this course but might give you an idea how the tools taught in this course are used in economic research.
